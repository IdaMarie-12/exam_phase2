""" As in Part I, the GUI will interact with your backend through a small set of functions. At a minimum,
 you must provide functions (in a separate module) that create and manipulate a DeliverySimulation
 instance.  The exact function signatures will be given in the project repository, and will mirror the Part I
 interface as closely as possible. Your task is to construct and manage the DeliverySimulation
 object behind these functions"""
