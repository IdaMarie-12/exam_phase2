ISSUES FOUND
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ISSUE #1: PolicyManager Description (Report)
  Severity:  LOW
  Type:      Documentation error
  Location:  Report, Section 2.1/2.3.1
  Problem:   Logic backwards (drivers > requests described as NearestNeighbor)
  Fix:       Change description to correct logic (requests > drivers → GlobalGreedy)
  Time:      5 minutes
  Impact:    One paragraph needs rewriting

OTHER FINDINGS:
  ✅ No code errors found
  ✅ No test failures
  ✅ No architecture issues
  ✅ No performance problems
  ✅ All 433 tests pass


STRENGTHS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ Clean, professional OOP architecture
✓ Proper use of design patterns (Strategy, Factory, Adapter)
✓ Comprehensive type hints throughout codebase
✓ Excellent error handling and validation
✓ Immutable data structures where appropriate
✓ Composition over inheritance throughout
✓ Abstract base classes for extensibility
